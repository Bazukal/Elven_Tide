# Elven_Tide

Elven Tide is a single player Android Roleplaying Game, based on the old Turn Style games.
The game does not have a cash shop to purchase items with real money, and does not force the player to watch ads.
However, if the player does choose to watch ads, they will receive a buff to drop rates and gold gained while fighting.

Items, Quests, NPC Chats and Skills are all stored in an XML file, that is read when the game starts and stores the data into a Manager.

The game has three different save slots, and uses the Persistant Data Files, that are Serialized as Binary to avoid unwanted access.
